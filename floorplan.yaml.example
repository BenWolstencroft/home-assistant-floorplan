# Example Floorplan Configuration
# Copy this to config/floorplan/floorplan.yaml and customize for your home

# Floors define vertical levels in your home
# height: Z-coordinate offset in meters (0 for ground floor, 3.0 for first floor, etc.)
floors:
  ground_floor:
    height: 0.0
  first_floor:
    height: 3.0

# Rooms define spaces on each floor
# boundaries: List of [X, Y] coordinates in meters forming a closed polygon
# All coordinates are from a single origin point (e.g., corner of your home)
