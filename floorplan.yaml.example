# Example Floorplan Configuration
# Copy this to config/floorplan/floorplan.yaml and customize for your home
# The integration auto-reloads this file every 2 seconds when changes are detected

# Floors define vertical levels in your home
# IMPORTANT: 'height' represents the CEILING HEIGHT of each floor, not the floor level
# This is used for filtering beacons and entities by floor
# Example: ground floor ceiling at 2.4m, first floor ceiling at 5.2m
# - Ground floor range: 0m to 2.4m (below its ceiling)
# - First floor range: 2.4m to 5.2m (from ground ceiling to first ceiling)
floors:
  ground_floor:
    height: 2.4  # Ceiling height in meters (floor friendly names auto-fetched from HA)
  first_floor:
    height: 5.2  # First floor ceiling (ground ceiling 2.4m + 2.8m floor height)

# Rooms define spaces on each floor
# boundaries: List of [X, Y] coordinates in meters forming a closed polygon
# All coordinates are from a single origin point (e.g., corner of your home)
# name: Optional - if omitted, uses the area name from Home Assistant area registry
# area: Optional - links to Home Assistant area ID for name lookup and organization
rooms:
  living_room:
    name: Living Room  # Optional: if omitted, uses name from area registry
    floor: ground_floor
    area: living_area  # Optional: Home Assistant area ID
    boundaries:
      - [0, 0]      # Bottom-left corner
      - [5, 0]      # Bottom-right corner
      - [5, 4]      # Top-right corner
      - [0, 4]      # Top-left corner
  
  kitchen:
    # No name specified - will use name from 'kitchen_area' in HA area registry
    floor: ground_floor
    area: kitchen_area
    boundaries:
      - [5, 0]
      - [9, 0]
      - [9, 4]
      - [5, 4]
  
  bedroom:
    name: Master Bedroom
    floor: first_floor
    area: bedroom_area
    boundaries:
      - [0, 0]
      - [4, 0]
      - [4, 3.5]
      - [0, 3.5]

# Static entities with fixed 3D coordinates [X, Y, Z] in meters
# Z coordinate is absolute height from ground level (not relative to floor)

# Moving entities configuration (for location tracking)
moving_entities:
  # Beacon nodes for BLE trilateration (Bermuda integration)
  # MAC address format: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF (colon or hyphen separated)
  # Device friendly names are automatically fetched from Home Assistant device registry
